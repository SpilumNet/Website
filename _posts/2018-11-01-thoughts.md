description: Thoughts I have about the website
---
I haven't really been active on posting stuff on this blog.
The reason for this is mainly because I am not much of a blogger and prefer to keep thoughts to myself.

Anyways, I have some ideas for the website.

1. Figure out how to organize posts by date and display an x number of posts per page.
  > > Now I can't remember if I already did this or not, but it is essential for a blogging site.

2. Add an interactive list of game servers to the website.
  > > In the future I plan on hosting a few game servers and I want them to be displayed on the site.

3. Embed discord onto website.
  > > And by this I do not mean the simple embed feature already built into discord, I want people to have extensive interaction with the discord server from the site.

4. Add a media page.
  > > A page with media such as pictures, videos, audio files and etc.

I might even make a page on the website with a to-do list.
